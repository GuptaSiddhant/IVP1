## Best Groups:  
The group which is most efficient with all skills and complements each otherâ€™s interests and skills.


My proposed group is one where at least one member is efficient in at least one skill. Since there are less than 12 members in a group, few must be efficient in more than one skill.
All 10 groups (of 8-9 members) will have similar efficiency in all skills if students are distributed by following method. (Since this sorting is based on skill, only quantitative data is used.)
First, through a bar graph of first-Skill (vs) Students, find the top 10 students of the particular skill and add them to groups 1-10 respectively. Repeat the same process with all other skills.
Now, every group has 12 names but there will be some repetitions. Remove the receptions and if the number of members reach 8 or 9, stop.
If number below 8, repeat the earlier process, but skip the top 10 this time and aim at next 10 for each skill.
Repeating this process will sort all students in similarly efficient groups.

The interactive chart is created using D3. Visualisation Link:   http://git.guptasiddhant.com/IVP1/index.html
